Enhance the UI/UX design of the GentlemenClub-PoC-version project to the highest professional standard, creating a visually stunning and user-friendly interface for our GambleFi DAO platform. Preserve the core essence of The Gentlemen's Club: a luxurious, compliant, and trusted on-chain gaming experience targeting high-net-worth gamblers in the $10B+ GambleFi market (Investor Deck Slide 2). The design must reflect the “Old Luxury” aesthetic (Slide 9) with dark blue (#1E3A8A), gold (#D4AF37), and white (#FFFFFF) colors, serif fonts (e.g., Playfair Display), and elegant elements like subtle gradients and ornate borders.

Requirements:
1. **Homepage**: Redesign `index.html` to feature:
   - A hero section with a bold headline: “The Gentlemen's Club: Licensed GambleFi DAO” (Slide 2).
   - A call-to-action button: “Join the DAO” or “Place a Bet” (Slide 4: 80% NGR to DAO).
   - A background with a dark blue-to-black gradient and gold accents (Slide 9).
2. **Betting Interface**: Create a `/betting` page (e.g., `betting.html` or React component) with:
   - A clean layout for placing $GTLM bets (mock token, Slide 5).
   - Real-time bet status (e.g., “Bet Placed: 100 $GTLM”).
   - Compliance toggle (e.g., “KYC Verified”, Slide 6: Curaçao license).
3. **DAO Dashboard**: Design a `/dao` page for governance (e.g., `dao.html`):
   - Display staking rewards (30% treasury, Slide 4) and voting options (Slide 3).
   - Show treasury balance (mock 80% NGR, Slide 4).
   - Use collapsible menus for clarity.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile and desktop compatibility with Tailwind CSS or custom media queries.
5. **Performance**: Optimize assets (e.g., compress images, minify CSS/JS) for fast load times.
6. **Compliance Hooks**: Add visual placeholders for KYC/AML (e.g., a “Verify Identity” modal, Slide 7: $2K budget).
7. **Branding**: Embed the “Old Luxury” aesthetic in all pages:
   - Use Playfair Display for headings, Lora for body text.
   - Include subtle animations (e.g., hover effects on buttons).
   - Add a footer with “gentlemensclub.app” and mock social links (Slide 9).

Constraints:
- Use existing tech stack (Node.js, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, or React if present in `package.json`).
- Avoid external APIs or file I/O unless mocked (Replit compatibility).
- Keep changes within `/public` or `/src` folders, updating `index.html`, `styles.css`, or JS files.
- Do not alter smart contracts (e.g., `governance.sol`) unless explicitly needed for UI integration.
- Ensure code comments link to Investor Deck slides (e.g., `// Slide 2: Hero section`).

Output:
- Updated `index.html`, `styles.css`, and new files (e.g., `betting.html`, `dao.html`).
- A `/assets` folder with optimized images or fonts (e.g., Playfair Display via Google Fonts).
- A brief report in `UI-UX-Report.md` summarizing changes and how they preserve the story: “A trusted, luxurious GambleFi DAO with compliance and community ownership” (Slides 2, 3, 4).
