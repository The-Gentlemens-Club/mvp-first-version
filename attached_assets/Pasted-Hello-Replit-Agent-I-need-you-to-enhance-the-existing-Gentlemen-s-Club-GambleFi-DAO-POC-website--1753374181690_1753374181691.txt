Hello Replit Agent,

I need you to enhance the existing Gentlemen's Club GambleFi DAO POC website by generating additional images similar to my logo and implementing them on the site. The current project is a Node.js Repl with `index.html`, `GentlemenClub.sol`, and `server.js`, deployed on Replit. My logo is elegant and gentlemanly, likely featuring dark luxurious colors (e.g., black, gold, deep red) and motifs like a top hat, cane, or monogram, reflecting a sophisticated, trust-focused brand. Follow these steps:

**Instructions**:
1. **Generate Logo Variations**:
   - Use your image generation capabilities to create 3-5 unique images inspired by my logo’s style (elegant, dark-themed, gentlemanly motifs).
   - Ensure the images are in PNG format with a transparent background, sized approximately 200x200 pixels.
   - Save the generated images as `logo_variation_1.png`, `logo_variation_2.png`, etc., in the Repl’s root directory.
2. **Implement Images on the Website**:
   - Update `index.html` to display these logo variations in the header or footer of the existing POC.
   - Add a new `<div>` section (e.g., `<div class="logo-variations">`) to showcase the images, using Tailwind CSS for styling (e.g., `grid grid-cols-3 gap-4`).
   - Ensure the images are clickable, linking to the `#staking` section for user engagement.
   - Maintain the current functionality (betting, staking, governance) without disruption.
3. **Verify Integration**:
   - Ensure the server (`server.js`) serves the new images by keeping `app.use(express.static('public'))` and placing images in the `public` folder if needed.
   - Test the live URL to confirm the logo variations appear and link correctly.
4. **Output**:
   - Provide the updated live URL of the Repl.
   - Confirm the images are generated and integrated successfully, noting any issues.

**Additional Notes**:
- The logo variations should align with The Gentlemen's Club’s brand (elegant, dark, trust-focused).
- If image generation fails, suggest alternative design tools or manual upload steps.
- Ensure the website remains compliant with geo-restriction prompts for staking.

Please execute these steps and share the live URL with a confirmation that the logo variations are implemented.
