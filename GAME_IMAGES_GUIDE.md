# How to Add Real Game Images to GentlemenClub

## Important Legal Notice
I cannot fetch and use copyrighted game images from the internet due to legal restrictions. Game providers like NetEnt, Evolution Gaming, and Pragmatic Play own the rights to their game imagery.

## Current Setup
The games currently use placeholder images with the game names. The code is ready to display real images - you just need to provide them legally.

## How to Add Real Game Images

### Option 1: Official Provider Images (Recommended)
1. **Become an Affiliate/Partner**: Most game providers offer media kits with official images for affiliates
   - Evolution Gaming: https://www.evolution.com/partners
   - NetEnt: Part of Evolution Group
   - Pragmatic Play: https://www.pragmaticplay.com/partners
   - Playtech: https://www.playtech.com/partners
   - Play'n GO: https://www.playngo.com/partners

2. **Download Official Assets**: Once approved, you'll get access to:
   - High-quality game thumbnails
   - Logo packs
   - Marketing materials
   - Usage rights documentation

### Option 2: Purchase Stock Images
- Buy casino/gaming stock photos from licensed providers:
  - Shutterstock
  - Getty Images
  - Adobe Stock
  - iStock

### Option 3: Create Custom Graphics
- Design your own game card images
- Use the generated images I created earlier
- Hire a designer to create custom thumbnails

## Implementation Steps

1. **Add your images** to the `attached_assets` folder:
   ```
   attached_assets/
   ├── games/
   │   ├── starburst.jpg
   │   ├── live-blackjack.jpg
   │   ├── lightning-roulette.jpg
   │   └── ... (other game images)
   ```

2. **Import the images** in `dashboard.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import starburstImg from "@assets/games/starburst.jpg";
   import blackjackImg from "@assets/games/live-blackjack.jpg";
   // ... import other images
   ```

3. **Update the gamesList** array:
   ```typescript
   const gamesList = [
     { 
       name: "Starburst", 
       provider: "NetEnt",
       imageUrl: starburstImg,  // Use imported image
       // ... other properties
     },
     // ... other games
   ];
   ```

## Current Placeholder System
The code currently uses `/api/placeholder/400/300?text=GameName` which displays a placeholder with the game name. This is:
- ✅ Copyright-safe
- ✅ Professional looking
- ✅ Clear for demo purposes
- ✅ Easy to replace with real images

## Legal Considerations
- **Never use** screenshots from casino websites without permission
- **Never use** images from Google Images without checking licenses
- **Always verify** you have the right to use any image commercially
- **Keep documentation** of your image licenses/permissions

## Need Help?
If you have legally obtained game images and need help implementing them, just:
1. Add them to the `attached_assets` folder
2. Let me know the filenames
3. I'll update the code to use them

Remember: Using copyrighted images without permission can lead to legal issues and takedown notices.
